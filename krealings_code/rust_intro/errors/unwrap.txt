unwrap 

If an 'Option' type has Some value or a 'Result' type has a Ok value, the value inside them passes to the next step.

If the 'Option' type has None value or the 'Result' type has Err value, program panics; 
    If Err, panics with the error messaage

expect()
    Similar to unwrap() but can set a custom message for the panics.

    pizzachu().expect("There was an Pokemon error");
